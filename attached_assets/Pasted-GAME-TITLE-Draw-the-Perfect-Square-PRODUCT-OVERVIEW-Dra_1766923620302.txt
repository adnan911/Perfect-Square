GAME TITLE
Draw the Perfect Square

PRODUCT OVERVIEW

Draw the Perfect Square is a casual, skill-based web game where the player attempts to draw a perfect square using mouse or touch input. After the drawing is completed, the system analyzes the shape and provides a score based on geometric accuracy.

Core idea: Test human precision against mathematical perfection.

TARGET PLATFORM

Platform: Web (Desktop + Mobile)
Development Environment: Replit

CORE GAME FLOW

User opens the game

User clicks “Start”

Blank canvas appears

User draws a square in one continuous stroke

User releases mouse or touch

System analyzes the drawing

Score and feedback are shown

User can retry or continue

GAME RULES

Only one continuous stroke is allowed

Drawing must form a closed shape

Drawing starts on pointer down

Drawing ends on pointer up

No undo during a draw

Canvas resets after each attempt

SCORING CRITERIA

Each drawing is evaluated using the following metrics:

Side Equality
All four sides should be similar in length

Angle Accuracy
Each corner should be close to 90 degrees

Line Straightness
Each side should have minimal curvature

Closure Accuracy
Start and end points must be very close

Symmetry
Overall balance of the shape

SCORE CALCULATION

Final score ranges from 0 to 100

Suggested weighting:

Angle Accuracy: 30%
Side Equality: 30%
Straightness: 25%
Closure Accuracy: 15%

Final Score = weighted average of all metrics

FEEDBACK SYSTEM

Score Feedback Mapping:

95–100 → “Perfect Square”
85–94 → “Almost Perfect”
70–84 → “Good Attempt”
Below 70 → “Needs Practice”
